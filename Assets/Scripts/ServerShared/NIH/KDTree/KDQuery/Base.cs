/*
The object used for querying. This object should be persistent - re-used for querying.
Contains internal array for pooling, so that it doesn't generate (too much) garbage.
The array never down-sizes, only up-sizes, so the more you use this object, less garbage will it make over time.

Should be used only by 1 thread,
which means each thread should have it's own KDQuery object in order for querying to be thread safe.

KDQuery can query different KDTrees.
