**user**: please rewrite this note to fix a few things:
Every idea from the Future Improvements section (aside from the bit mentioning Elysium) should be part of the timeline instead. As their core competency is AGI engineering, it would be their systems controlling the drone and mining swarms along with the metamaterial net being capable of changing its properties dynamically.

**ai**: Okay, I'll rewrite the [[Cavitation]] note, incorporating the "Future Improvements" into the main timeline and adjusting details to reflect Orbital Forge's core competency in AGI engineering. I'll also emphasize the dynamic properties of the metamaterial net.

Here's the revised note:

### Orbital Cavity Construction (OCC)

Orbital Cavity Construction, often shortened to "Orb-Cav" or simply "Cavitation," is the dominant method of creating large-scale, habitable space structures. Pioneered by [[Orbital Forge]] (OF), it revolutionized space colonization by shifting from fragile, modular habitats to robust, self-contained environments carved directly from asteroids. The process, initially crude, has become a symbol of humanity's (and uplift's) ingenuity and adaptability in the face of the harsh realities of space.

#### Genesis: The "Forge-in-Place" Breakthrough ([[Age of Automation]])

The seeds of OCC were sown during the [[Age of Automation]] (2100-2250). [[Orbital Forge]], initially known for its anarchic [[Artificial General Intelligence]] and rogue AI labs, was also a major player in asteroid mining. Traditional methods involved piecemeal extraction and external processing, which was slow, inefficient, and prone to dangerous accidents. OF engineers, driven by a combination of necessity and a rebellious spirit, began experimenting with a radical new approach: processing the asteroid *in situ*.

The first key innovation was the **Metamaterial Containment Net (MCN)**. Developed in partnership with **Isotropic Weavers**, a smaller, highly specialized firm focused on advanced materials science, the MCN was a flexible, yet incredibly strong, net composed of interlocking carbon nanotubes and diamondoid weaves. (Isotropic later became absorbed by the ever expanding [[SolEx]], but not before the patent became the focal point of a solar-system-wide debate that ended with open licenses to all cavity construction technologies. This net could be deployed around an asteroid, conforming to its irregular shape and providing a sealed, controlled environment. It could be controlled by embedded, simple [[Artificial General Intelligence|AGI]] systems for dynamic adaptability.

The second crucial element was the **Resonant Shatter Swarm (RSS)**. These weren't simply mining drones; they were a coordinated network of specialized machines, each with a specific role and all under the control of a central AGI:

*   **Surveyors:** Mapped the asteroid's composition and identified optimal fracture points.
*   **Resonators:** Emitted precisely tuned vibrations to induce controlled fracturing along pre-determined lines, minimizing waste and maximizing yield.
*   **Collectors:** Gathered the fragmented ore and transported it to processing nodes within the MCN.
*   **Weavers:** Used the processed material to reinforce the MCN and begin constructing the internal structure, guided by the central AGI, adapting to the asteroid's unique characteristics.

By 2170, [[Orbital Forge]] had successfully demonstrated the first "Forge-in-Place" prototype, transforming a small, nickel-iron asteroid into a rudimentary cylindrical habitat. This early success, though crude and fraught with challenges, proved the viability of the OCC process.

#### Refinement and Standardization ([[Identity Crisis]])

The [[Identity Crisis]] (2250-2500) saw OCC evolve from a promising experiment into a standardized, albeit often chaotic, industry. [[Orbital Forge]], despite its rebellious nature, recognized the need for some level of standardization to ensure the safety and stability of the burgeoning cavity habitats. They released open-source guidelines for MCN deployment and RSS operation, albeit with "hidden" backdoors and proprietary control codes that gave OF-built systems a significant advantage. OF's continued advancement were motivated by the desire to use their superior AGI technology to maintain a competitive advantage.

Key advancements during this period included:

*   **Centrifugal Agglomeration:** After the asteroid was fragmented and processed, the MCN would begin rotating, using centrifugal force to compact the rubble into a dense, stable shell. This eliminated the need for extensive external scaffolding and significantly reduced construction time. **Automated Cavitation:** Fully autonomous systems, guided by advanced AGI, could potentially construct entire cavity habitats with minimal human intervention. [[Orbital Forge]] continued to refine its AGI technology, making this capability a reality by 2400.
*   **Tailored Conglomerate Paving (TCP):** [[VitaForge]], known for its [[Biodrone]] engineering, developed bio-engineered organisms that could process the raw asteroid material into a durable, biocompatible "living concrete." This conglomerate could be tailored to specific needs, creating everything from radiation shielding to fertile soil for agriculture. **Self-Repairing Habitats:** By 2450, Genetically engineered organisms, designed by [[VitaForge]] and integrated into the [[Tailored Conglomerate Paving]], could autonomously repair damage to the habitat structure, reducing the need for risky and expensive maintenance.
*    **Adaptive Interiors:** Dynamic, reconfigurable internal structures that respond to changing needs and population densities, were made possible by 2480 by [[Orbital Forge]]'s advanced AGIs controlling the MCN and RSS.

*   **Hub and Spoke Architecture:** The final stage involved installing a central hub within the rotating cylinder. This hub housed life support systems, docking facilities, and a network of "light pipes" that distributed artificial sunlight throughout the interior, mimicking a day/night cycle. Elevators connected the hub to the inner surface, creating a readily traversable environment.

#### The "Cavity Rush" and Social Impact

The standardization of OCC led to a "Cavity Rush," with corporations and even independent collectives racing to claim and transform asteroids. This rapid expansion had profound social and economic consequences:

*   **Democratization of Space:** OCC dramatically lowered the cost of creating habitable space, making colonization accessible to a wider range of groups.
*   **Rise of "Cavity Cultures":** Each cavity habitat, with its unique internal environment and population, began to develop its own distinct culture. This led to a vibrant, but often fragmented, social landscape.
*   **Labor Exploitation:** While OCC reduced the need for dangerous extravehicular activity, it also created new forms of labor exploitation. [[Biodrone]]s were often used extensively in the initial stages of construction, raising ethical concerns.
* **Black Swan Engineers:** OF’s tendency to only provide rough documentation and hidden controls led to a lucrative trade in expertise for modifying and repairing Cavitation systems, and those that were not part of the OF hierarchy were referred to as the Black Swans, in reference to the statistical anomalies they were adept at resolving.

OCC represents a pivotal point in the setting's history. It’s a technology that both empowers and exploits, reflecting the complex interplay of innovation, ambition, and social consequences that defines this science fiction universe.
