**user**: I'd like to describe a model of asteroid mining which is deeply interconnected with habitat construction. After all, most asteroids are not bound very tightly together, gravitationally. The process requires putting a metamaterial net around the asteroid, then iteratively and explosively breaking it into pieces with a drone swarm, then another drone swarm processes it for ores. After that, the agglomeration is spun up, with the net containing the debris and expanding into a cylinder, which is then has its interior filled in and paved with tailored conglomerate produced from the rocks. Then a hub is installed along with elevators to the inside surface of the new cylinder, with light being piped in and distributed from the hub for day/night cycles. The surface can be sculpted and zoned for farmland, urban or suburban colony space.

Please write out a note detailing the process and its historical development. Let's say this process was created and refined by the Orbital Forge faction - they really need something to be *their* thing. Cryonix is just the frontrunner in superconductor tech, they're not *that* relevant - if OF need a partner for the metamaterials tech we can either spin up a new faction for it or assign it to someone else.
