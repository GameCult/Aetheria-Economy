### Forge Spinning: From Asteroid to Habitat

Forge Spinning is the revolutionary process that transformed asteroid mining from a niche industry into the cornerstone of off-world colonization. Developed and perfected by [[Orbital Forge]] (OF), it's a testament to their chaotic ingenuity and relentless pursuit of efficiency, even at the expense of safety or aesthetics. It's a brutal, rapid, and highly effective method of converting asteroids into livable habitats, embodying OF's core philosophy: "Build fast, break things, and don't look back."

#### Historical Development

*   **Early Attempts (Pre-2100, [[Corporate Exodus]]):** Initial asteroid mining focused on extracting specific, high-value ores. Methods were slow, expensive, and involved selective extraction, often leaving the bulk of the asteroid unused. Companies like Horizon Ventures (precursor to [[SolEx]]) used conventional mining techniques and chemical rockets, limiting profitability and scale.
*   **The Metamaterial Breakthrough (2120s, Early [[Age of Automation]]):** The key innovation came with the development of strong, flexible metamaterial nets by [[AstroDyne]]. These nets, composed of woven carbon nanotubes and impact-resistant polymers, could completely envelop an asteroid, providing structural integrity and containment. [[AstroDyne]]'s materials division focused on developing the strongest and most adaptable materials, allowing for a wider range of asteroid sizes and compositions to be exploited.
*  **Orbital Forge Takes Over (2150s, [[Age of Automation]]):** [[Orbital Forge]], known for its expertise in rapid prototyping and unconventional engineering, recognized the potential of [[AstroDyne]]'s metamaterials. OF acquired the tech "[[AstroDyne]]'s metamaterials" -legally or not is a matter of debate- and coupled them with AGI-controlled drone swarms. The first swarm delivers the net. The second swarm deploys shaped charges, fracturing the asteroid into manageable pieces *without* dispersing the material. The use of AGIs was key, allowing for real-time adjustments based on asteroid composition and fracture patterns.
*   **Rapid Processing and Agglomeration (2170s, [[Age of Automation]]):** A third drone swarm, equipped with specialized processing tools, refines the fractured asteroid material. Volatiles like water ice are extracted, and metals are separated. The remaining rock is crushed and mixed with binding agents, creating a tailored conglomerate. This "Forgecrete" is then used to pave the interior of the spinning, net-enclosed asteroid. [[Orbital Forge]]'s AGIs optimized the conglomerate mix for each asteroid, ensuring structural integrity and resource efficiency.
*   **Spin-Up and Expansion (2190s, [[Age of Automation]]):** Once the fractured asteroid is contained, the entire assembly is gradually spun up. The metamaterial net, anchored by drones, provides the necessary tensile strength. As the spin increases, centrifugal force pushes the rubble outwards, expanding the asteroid into a cylindrical shape. This is a delicate process, requiring precise control to avoid catastrophic failure – something [[Orbital Forge]] learned the hard way through numerous spectacular (and costly) accidents.
*   **Interior Construction (2200s, Late [[Age of Automation]] / Early [[Identity Crisis]]):** With the cylinder formed, the interior is filled and paved with the Forgecrete. A central hub is constructed, housing elevators and access points for light pipes. These pipes, developed by [[NiteLife Energy]], channel concentrated sunlight from external collectors, creating artificial day/night cycles within the habitat.
*   **Surface Sculpting and Zoning (2220s+, [[Identity Crisis]]):** The final stage involves sculpting the outer surface of the cylinder. [[Orbital Forge]]'s AGIs, drawing on vast databases of urban planning and agricultural data, create zones for farmland, urban development, and suburban housing. This process is often rushed and haphazard, reflecting OF's pragmatic approach. Aesthetic considerations are secondary to functionality.
* **Refinements and Imitations (2250+):** While [[Orbital Forge]] pioneered the process, other factions have attempted to replicate it. [[SolEx]] developed a slower, more methodical version, prioritizing safety and structural integrity. [[Aeronautics Unlimited]] focused on scaling up the process, creating larger habitats but often sacrificing quality. However, [[Orbital Forge]] remains the undisputed master of Forge Spinning, their habitats known for their rapid construction, rugged design, and (occasionally) catastrophic failures.

#### Cultural Impact

Forge Spinning became synonymous with [[Orbital Forge]]'s brand. Their habitats are seen as both marvels of engineering and symbols of a chaotic, frontier spirit. The "Forge-Born," those who live in these habitats, are often viewed as resilient, adaptable, and slightly reckless – a reflection of the process that created their homes. The inherent dangers and occasional failures associated with Forge Spinning have also fueled a subculture of "Forge Hackers," individuals who specialize in repairing and modifying these habitats, often pushing them beyond their original design limits. [[Lucent Media]] loves to showcase the "Forge-Born", and their daredevil attitudes.

The rapid, almost brutal efficiency of Forge Spinning also contrasts sharply with the more methodical approaches of other factions, highlighting a fundamental divide in the culture of space colonization. The "Forge-Born" represent a fast, chaotic, and ultimately unsustainable approach, while others, like [[SolEx]], prioritize long-term stability, even if it means slower progress. This dichotomy continues to shape the social and political landscape of the solar system, and beyond.
