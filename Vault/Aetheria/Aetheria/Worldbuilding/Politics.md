In Aetheria's corporate-controlled solar system, warfare is a tightly regulated affair, governed by the Pan Solar Consortium's legal framework to ensure that competition remains profitable and sustainable. Through conflict permits, damage caps, neutral zones, and robust enforcement mechanisms, the PSC prevents factions like Zhestokost from unleashing unchecked destruction. Warfare is thus a strategic tool—used for economic gain, market control, and leverage—rather than a path to mutual annihilation. Even the most ruthless corporations must play by these rules or risk losing everything in the cutthroat game of solar capitalism.
