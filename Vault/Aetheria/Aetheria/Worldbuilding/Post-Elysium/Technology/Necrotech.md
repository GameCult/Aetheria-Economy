##### Necrotech

Some corporations leverage the potential of [[Aether]]ic spirit creation in the ethically dubious practice of breeding genetically engineered human espers and harvesting them en masse to bind their souls to technological products. These can accomplish roughly the same effects as specialized embodied [[Artificial General Intelligence]], but require regular refueling if they arenâ€™t designed to be disposable. They are more generalizable and faster to develop since they do not require the extensive work of iterating on embodied AGI minds, but greater per-unit costs means they lose out in economies of scale for mass-produced items.

As with other questionable and horrifying corporate practices, a lot of effort is spent in managing public perception of the technology. Only countercultural dissidents ever call it necrotech or their production lines necrofactories. The corporations themselves prefer to label them *Aetheric Resonance Interfaces*, making it sound like an advanced energy phenomenon rather than forced spirit entrapment. The media is flooded with propaganda explaining how necrotech is "completely humane" and "scientifically proven" to be non-conscious, while suppressing evidence of sentience in bound spirits.
