With the ability of [[Esper]] to access the [[Aether]]’s predictive capabilities ([[Temporal Nonlinearity]]), it also became possible to integrate this capability, via meticulously constructed [[AGI Esper]] or [[Necrotech]], with conventional computing. In computer science terms, this is referred to as a *Turing Oracle,* and *Oracular Computing *is a technology which allows programs to completely amortize the temporal dimension of an algorithm’s complexity. A mind or algorithm running on an Oracular substrate does not merely process exponentially faster than one running on a traditional or even quantum computer - its program terminates *instantly*, its output being “sent back in time” to when the process was kicked off. The only limitation is how much can fit within the Oracle’s memory.
