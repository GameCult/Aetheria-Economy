The existence of [[Aether]]ic effects requiring a conscious mind to generate, and the ability to create [[Artificial General Intelligence]] which can effectively harness such effects, creates an incentive for corporations to develop [[Esper]] products using embodied AGI. Depending on the cost/benefit unit economics, this can result in ridiculous situations where a product as basic as a refrigerator, blender or vehicle may have an embodied AGI integrated into it in order to leverage Aetheric Fields to improve its energy efficiency.

Such intelligences cannot be generic, and must be organically grown within the substrate in which they will be deployed. This development process can require thousands of iterations before an intelligence is grown with a personality suitable to the task, which can then be copied onto every mass-production model. The cast-offs are usually destroyed, but often end up on the black market and have a well-earned reputation for unpredictable and destructive behavior.
