### Colonizing Sol

In the near future, privatization of space exploration accelerated under the guise of *efficiency *and *innovation*. Space agencies became increasingly reliant on corporate partners. Governments, strapped for cash and politically divided, further delegated responsibilities to these private entities, essentially ceding space infrastructure to corporate interests.

International organizations originally designed to prevent corporate monopolization and nationalistic expansion were rendered toothless as corporate lobbyists pushed for deregulation to incentivize investment. The Artemis Accords and similar agreements started favoring corporate rights over national interests, with enforcement left to the very entities that benefited from their loosening.

As technology advanced, resource extraction from asteroids, the Moon, and other planets became economically viable. The first off-world colonies were not governmental efforts but rather corporate outposts, justified as "public-private partnerships" that were, in reality, purely corporate-controlled.

Colonists were not citizens but *employees*, subject to corporate law rather than any national or international jurisdiction. Colonists had to pay for their own transport, housing, even air and water, creating a situation where they can never leave unless they buy their freedom (which is near impossible) and generating debt which would ensure themselves and their descendants remain indefinitely indentured to their corporation.

Earth governments still existed but were mostly symbolic, acting as legacy institutions that rubber-stamp corporate activities. The United Nations attempted to assert control but fractured as some Earth nations aligned with particular corporate factions. International treaties evolved to recognize corporate holdings as sovereign.

As corporations became the de facto governing entities in space, they began vertically integrating every aspect of life. Everything—oxygen, water, food, healthcare, security—is controlled by a single corporate entity within a colony. Corporate scrip replaced traditional money in off-world settlements, ensuring that wages earned could only be spent within the corporate ecosystem. With no independent oversight, labor conditions deteriorated into near-serfdom, but most colonists had no way to leave.

While Earth was still home to billions, its relevance waned. The elite class, who own shares in the corporations, lived in isolated, heavily fortified arcologies. Climate change and resource depletion left Earth struggling, making off-world life seem preferable even if it meant living in corporate servitude. Despite their independence, megacorporations still inherit cultural influences from their founding nations.

In the end, a pan-solar governing body exists in name only. It is not a real government but an arbitration body that settles disputes between corporations, ensuring stability for the capitalist class. It serves as a legal fiction that corporations use to give their rule an air of legitimacy. Any attempt to enforce laws against corporate interests is met with lobbying, bribery, and even corporate-backed coups on Earth governments that step out of line.
