*Dominion Over All*

A late-forming (2740) corporate-political juggernaut asserting system-wide control through governance, tech, and military might, with a grandiose, authoritarian vibe.

Sol Dominion unifies the coalition with overarching rule, CogniSys ensures control via AGI, GeneSys enhances its elite, Quantum Dynamics pioneers FTL, and Rossum & Douglas stabilizes tech.
