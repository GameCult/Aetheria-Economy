*Wisdom through Peace*

An uplift-led coalition guided by uplifted elephants, rooted in pacifism, ethical resistance, and sustainability, with a grounded, earthy aesthetic reflecting their heritage.

The Elephant Enclave leads with moral authority and communal decision-making, backed by the Aya Collective for ethics, Ewan Hart Inc. for sustainability, and the Preservationists for sentient rights.
