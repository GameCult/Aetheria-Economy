*People will do anything for the adulation or loathing of their peers. We at Lucent have harnessed that heretofore destructive tendency for the benefit of all.*

Lucent Media has successfully weaponized the reality show, to their great benefit and the great chagrin of everyone else who has to deal with them. "Life is a game, so make sure you're the winner" is the message drilled into the consciousness of its audience from their first cell division. It is safest to assume everything one does in the sectors controlled by Lucent is being recorded, and, if sufficiently interesting or embarrassing, being broadcast to the entire blast radius of a supernova.

A coalition manipulating culture and perception through tailored media and entertainment, with a glossy, consumerist aesthetic that hides its controlling nature.

Lucent Media crafts the overarching narrative, maintaining a centralized grip on ideology. [[Alakrita]] caters to elites, [[Corriedales]] targets families, [[EternaMind]] and their [[Immortal Aristocrats]] wield influence from above, while [[Reality Architects]] help shape perception.

## Culture

Lucent Media’s culture revolves around one core principle: visibility is power. From birth, citizens—or “stars,” as Lucent prefers—are conditioned to see every moment as an audition. “Life is a game, so make sure you’re the winner” isn’t just a slogan; it’s a survival mantra. Children are handed AR implants and social scoring apps before they can walk, taught to curate their lives for maximum likes, shares, and viral potential. Privacy is a myth—Lucent’s omnipresent cameras, drones, and neural feeds ensure that everything you do is recorded, analyzed, and, if it’s juicy enough, broadcast to billions.

Social hierarchy is dictated by “Clout,” a real-time metric of an individual’s influence, charisma, and audience draw. Those with Clout live in glittering orbital studios or arcology penthouses, their every move a performance, while those without toil in obscurity, relegated to menial jobs or edited out of the narrative entirely. Relationships—romantic, familial, professional—are staged for drama; betrayal and reconciliation are scripted by AI directors to keep viewers hooked. Even dissent is co-opted—protests against Lucent are televised as “underdog arcs,” with rebels cast as plucky heroes until they’re either crushed or absorbed into the brand.

Art and entertainment are indistinguishable from life itself. Lucent’s AI-driven media engines churn out personalized content—holo-dramas, music, even dreams—tailored to exploit individual triggers. Citizens don’t consume media; they live it. Fashion reflects this: garish, ever-changing outfits designed for maximum screen impact, embedded with micro-cameras and haptic feedback to amplify emotional reactions. The ultimate taboo in Lucent society isn’t violence or deceit—it’s being boring.

Lucent’s most devoted citizens worship entertainment itself. Their ultimate aspiration is ascension into Eternals—those who have achieved permanent cultural relevance through constant engagement. These figures have their consciousness backed up across infinite media platforms, ensuring that they remain profitable even in death.

## Economy

Lucent Media’s economy is built on attention, not credits. [[PSCC]] is permitted, but it’s secondary to Buzz, a blockchain-based scrip earned through engagement—likes, views, shares, or starring in a viral moment. Buzz buys everything from food to cybernetic upgrades, but its value fluctuates wildly based on algorithmic trends, ensuring constant competition. Workers aren’t paid wages; they’re paid in exposure, with the promise that enough Buzz will translate into Clout—and maybe wealth. Most never cash out—addictive feedback loops keep them chasing the next hit of fame.

The corporation’s revenue streams are vast: ad placements in neural feeds, premium subscriptions for unfiltered “raw life” streams, and data sales to other megacorporations. Lucent’s AI analysts predict consumer behavior with uncanny precision, selling insights to firms like [[Finch Cybernetics]] or [[NiteLife Energy]]. Physical products—clothing, tech, biodrones—are secondary, branded with Lucent logos and designed as props for the endless show. Biodrones, marketed as “Audience Amplifiers,” perform stunts or labor on camera, their suffering edited into slapstick comedy or gritty realism depending on the target demographic.

Lucent employs a small army of human “Content Curators” and AGI “Narrative Architects” to oversee the chaos, but the real labor force is the audience itself—billions of stars and viewers generating value through their own exploitation. Underground markets trade in “shadow streams,” illicit feeds free of Lucent’s curation, but even these are often infiltrated and rebranded as “rebel exclusives.”

## Aesthetic

Lucent Media’s aesthetic screams excess—bright, clashing neons, holographic billboards, and architecture that looks like a fever dream of a game show set. Orbital stations glitter with mirrored surfaces and pulsing lights, every angle optimized for drone shots. Interiors are fluid, with AR overlays turning drab worker dorms into dazzling virtual stages. Uniformity is despised—every space, product, and person is a canvas for customization, ensuring no two feeds look alike.

Products are flashy and disposable: cybernetic implants with glowing accents, drones that explode into confetti after a single use, clothing that shifts color based on viewer polls. Functionality takes a backseat to flair—Lucent’s tech is prone to glitches, but that’s just more fodder for the “epic fail” compilations. Propaganda saturates everything: towering holo-statues of top influencers, slogans like “Shine or Fade” pulsing across neural interfaces, and AI avatars chirping encouragement—or mockery—24/7.

## Key Figures

Lucent Media’s leadership is a rotating cast of celebrity-executives, their minds uploaded not for eternity but for relevance. Unlike [[Zhestokost]]’s rigid council, Lucent’s rulers thrive on adaptability, their personalities rewritten by AI to match trending archetypes. They’re less commanders and more avatars of the brand—immortal only as long as they keep the audience hooked.

## Legacy

Today, Lucent Media dominates Elysium’s cultural landscape, a glittering parasite feeding on every emotion, conflict, and dream. Its leaders orchestrate an endless spectacle, blurring reality and fiction until no one remembers the difference. The development of the Aethernet—years after the initial chaos—supercharged Lucent’s reach, allowing galaxy-wide broadcasts that dwarfed their Sol-era ambitions. Enemies call it shallow; Lucent calls it genius. In a universe of trade and treachery, Lucent’s currency—attention—reigns supreme.
