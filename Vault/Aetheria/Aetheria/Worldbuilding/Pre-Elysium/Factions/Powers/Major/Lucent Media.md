*People will do anything for the adulation or loathing of their peers. We at Lucent have harnessed that heretofore destructive tendency for the benefit of all.*

Lucent Media has successfully weaponized the reality show, to their great benefit and the great chagrin of everyone else who has to deal with them. "Life is a game, so make sure you're the winner" is the message drilled into the consciousness of its audience from their first cell division. It is safest to assume everything one does in the sectors controlled by Lucent is being recorded, and, if sufficiently interesting or embarrassing, being broadcast to the entire blast radius of a supernova.

A coalition manipulating culture and perception through tailored media and entertainment, with a glossy, consumerist aesthetic that hides its controlling nature.

Lucent Media crafts the overarching narrative, maintaining a centralized grip on ideology. [[Alakrita]] caters to elites, [[Corriedales]] targets families, [[EternaMind]] and their [[Immortal Aristocrats]] wield influence from above, while [[Reality Architects]] help shape perception.
