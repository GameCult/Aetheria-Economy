## 2500–2750

### [[Algorithmic Social Control]]

Key Players: [[Lucent Media]], with [[Raven Collective]] subversion.

[[Lucent Media]]’s tailored realities emerged in 2350, perfected by 2600 to shape perception. Ravens hack them by 2700, spawning "[[Truth Cults]]" against corporate lies.
#### Cultural Impact

[[Lucent Media]]’s "[[Reality Architects]]" control masses, opposed by [[Raven Collective]]-led "Chaos Weavers." The [[Cetacean Navigators]] and the [[Elephant Enclave]] opt out, forging identities with [[Aya Collective]] support.
### The [[Cognitum]] and [[Mind Uploading]]

Key Players: The [[Cognitum]], with ties to [[Finch Cybernetics]] and [[SolEx]], opposed by [[Aya Collective]], [[Rossum & Douglas]], and rogue uploads.

Emerging around 2550, the [[Cognitum]]—a secretive faction of scientists and elites—exploits uploaded minds for radical experiments. [[Finch Cybernetics]] refines the tech for accelerated brainwashing and modular cognition, while [[SolEx]] funds cognitive overclocking for strategic uploads. By 2600, they produced unstable geniuses and hive-minds, sold to [[Zhestokost]] for warfare.
###### Cultural Impact

The [[Cognitum]]’s actions spark ethical debates—[[Lucent Media]] spins them as "innovative pioneers," while [[Aya Collective]] decries them as torturers. Rogue uploads leak torment tales, amplifying unrest.
###### Opposing Factions
* [[Emancipated]] (2570): Escaped uploads, allied with [[Free Upload Network]], infiltrate [[Cognitum]] systems, leaking secrets via [[Raven Collective]] networks.
* [[Pragmatists]] (2610): Led by [[Rossum & Douglas]], they fear rogue superintelligences, sabotaging [[Cognitum]] hubs with [[Raven Collective]] aid and advocating via [[Lucent Media]] leaks.
* [[Preservationists]] (2630): Backed by [[Aya Collective]], they view uploads as sentient, rescuing them with [[Rossum & Douglas]] tech.
### Corporate Consolidation

Sol Dominion ([[SolEx]], [[CogniSys]], [[GeneSys]]) formed by 2740, bolstered by [[Zhestokost]]’s arsenal, [[NiteLife Energy]]’s power grid, and [[Cognitum]] research. [[AstroDyne]], [[Orbital Forge]], and uplifted factions (e.g., [[Cephalopod Syndicate]]) defy [[Pan-Solar Consortium]] authority.

The [[Pan-Solar Consortium]]’s presence solidifies with the formation of the Sol Dominion, which it struggles to regulate. Massive orbital stations—like the PSC Arbitration Spire—become symbols of its authority, bristling with surveillance tech and [[Private Military Contractors]] garrisons. The [[PSCC]] emerges as the universal reserve currency, backed by corporate scrip monopolies and enforced through economic sanctions, cementing the PSC’s economic clout.
