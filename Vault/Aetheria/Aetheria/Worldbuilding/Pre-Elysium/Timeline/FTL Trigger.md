## March 17, 3025

On March 17, 3025, Sol Dominion activated the FTL drive on Mars, powered by NiteLife Energy, guarded by Zhestokost, and aboard an Alakrita vessel. Cognitum’s unstable uploads, integrated into the drive’s systems, inadvertently tap aetheric forces. Humanity’s identity—uplifts, uploads, wireheading—shatters. The breach shunts all into Elysium.

The PSC’s final act—overseeing the Sol Dominion’s FTL drive activation—occurs at its Martian HQ, before the shunt to Elysium renders its infrastructure obsolete.
