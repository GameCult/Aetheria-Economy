## 2750–3025
### [[Wireheading]] Infohazards

Key Players: [[NeuroPulse]], [[Cognitum]] weaponizing, and [[Raven Collective]] subverting.

[[NeuroPulse]]’s [[Wireheading]] spreads by 2800, trapping users in bliss—with rapid spread enabled by tightly-integrated [[Brain-Computer Interfaces]] like those of [[Finch Cybernetics]]. The [[Cognitum]] experiments with [[wireheading]] on uploads, amplifying its effects; Ravens weaponize it by 2900 against elites and [[biodrone]]s—cephalopods resist via neural agility.
#### Cultural Impact

[[Hedonists]] collapse, [[Disciplinists]] (led by [[Zhestokost]]) ally with [[Cetacean Navigators]] and [[Elephant Enclave]]. The [[Pan-Solar Consortium]] falters as identity dissolves, with [[Lucent Media]] profiting from the chaos and [[Preservationists]] rescuing victims of [[wireheading]].

### FTL Principles

Key Players: [[Quantum Dynamics]], [[Sol Dominion]], and [[Cetacean Navigators]], with [[Alakrita]] providing elite ships and [[Cognitum]] aiding nonlocal cognition research.

[[Quantum Dynamics]] theorizes FTL by 2980, prototyping by 3010 with [[Cetacean Navigators]] aid. [[Cognitum]]’s late-2700s nonlocal cognition experiments—tested on unstable uploads—hint at proto-[[aether]]ic phenomena, aiding [[Quantum Dynamics]]. [[Alakrita]]’s failure-prone ships complete it in 3024 amid chaos.
#### Cultural Impact

Expansionists ([[Sol Dominion]], [[Cetacean Navigators]]) seek escape, [[Preservationists]] ([[Baseline League]], [[Raven Collective]], [[Elephant Enclave]], [[Aya Collective]]) resist, fearing loss—[[Pragmatists]] warn of [[Cognitum]]’s destabilizing uploads. [[Lucent Media]] frames it as the ultimate reality show. By the 2900s, an upload rights movement, driven by [[Preservationists]] and [[Emancipated]], gained traction but faltered against [[Sol Dominion]] and [[Cognitum]] resistance.

By 2800, [[Wireheading]] and resource collapse strain the [[Pan-Solar Consortium]]’s control, leading to fortified enclaves on Mars and Earth’s arcologies. Its physical presence peaks with automated defense systems neutralizing threats like unauthorized nuclear launches.
### Resource Collapse

By 2950, colonies crumbled, with [[Aeronautics Unlimited]] and [[Ewan Hart]]. struggling to sustain them. Uplifted factions hoard scraps, clashing with humans—[[Corriedales]] turns [[Biodrone]] scraps into “joyful” weapons. The [[Emancipated]] target [[Cognitum]] resource hubs.
