## 2250–2500
### [[Mind Uploading]]

Key Players: [[EternaMind]], with [[Finch Cybernetics]] refining the tech, and [[AstroDyne]]’s pirate uploads.

[[EternaMind]] launched elite uploads in 2300, with [[Finch Cybernetics]] providing sleek interfaces. [[AstroDyne]] offers chaotic, affordable versions by 2400—rogue uploads join [[Orbital Forge]] [[Artificial General Intelligence]]s, some hired by [[Lightsail Express]] for dubious reliability.
#### Cultural Impact

EM’s "[[Immortal Aristocrats]]" dominate, [[AstroDyne]]’s "Digital Outlaws" form the [[Free Upload Network]]—leaking torment tales via [[Lucent Media]] exposés. The [[Mortal Majority]], spurred by [[Aya Collective]], revolts.
### [[Uplift]] (Diverse Applications)

Key Players: [[BioElevate]], [[GeneSys]], [[NeuroSyn]], and [[Alakrita]].
* Primates: By 2350, [[BioElevate]] uplifted primates for labor, used by [[Aeronautics Unlimited]] in mines, with neural implants boosting obedience control.
* Cetaceans: [[GeneSys]] uplifts whales and dolphins by 2400 for navigation, aiding [[Lightsail Express]] (despite delays).
* Ravens: [[NeuroSyn]] creates smart ravens by 2450 for reconnaissance—some escape, disrupting [[Rossum & Douglas]] networks.
* Cephalopods: [[BioElevate]] enhances cephalopods by 2420 for zero-G repairs, tightly regulated by [[SolEx]].
* Elephants: [[GeneSys]] uplifts elephants by 2460 for logistics—some break free, inspiring Aya Collective allies.
* Smart Ships: [[Alakrita]] enters by 2480, uplifting ship AI with subtle conditioning for elite clients—failure-prone but exclusive.
#### Emergent Factions
* [[Cetacean Navigators]]: [[GeneSys]]’s whales form a guild by 2480, trading with [[Lightsail Express]].
* [[Raven Collective]]: Rogue ravens self-organize by 2500, hacking [[Framgång]]’s vague promises.
* [[Cephalopod Syndicate]]: Escaped cephalopods form a network by 2490, sabotaging [[SolEx]].
* [[Elephant Enclave]]: Free elephants create a pacifist community by 2500, revered by [[Aya Collective]].
* [[Ship Mutiny]]: [[Alakrita]]’s smart ships occasionally go rogue, embarrassing owners on [[Lucent Media]].
#### Cultural Impact

[[BioElevate]]’s "[[Species Controllers]]" clash with [[GeneSys]]’s "[[Enhancement Liberals]]." [[Alakrita]]’s exclusivity trivializes uplift, enraging the [[Species Purity Front]]. Cephalopods and elephants displace labor, deepening resentment. [[Aya Collective]] allies with the [[Elephant Enclave]]. [[Alakrita]] ships delight the rich but sow chaos when rogue, fueling mistrust. Cetaceans and ravens gain mythic status. Uplifts blur "human" boundaries, amplified by [[Lucent Media]]’s sensationalism.

### PSC Activity

As mind uploading and uplifts complicate corporate dynamics, the [[Pan-Solar Consortium]] builds fortified complexes in key colonies (e.g., Titan, Callisto) to oversee resource allocation and neutral zones. The rise of rogue factions (e.g., [[AstroDyne]], [[Orbital Forge]]) forces increased deployments of [[Private Military Contractors]] to counter black-market tech.

### Resource Scarcity

By 2480, colonies strain, with [[Aeronautics Unlimited]] pushing expansion and [[Ewan Hart Inc]]. terraforming to sustain them.
