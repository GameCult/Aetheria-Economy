## 2025–2100
### Early [[Brain-Computer Interfaces]]

Key Players: [[NeuroSyn]], with [[Finch Cybernetics]] emerging as a sleek, innovative rival, and [[AstroDyne]]’s Cyberspace Division competing.

By 2080, [[NeuroSyn]] rolls out subscription-based [[Brain-Computer Interfaces]] to boost off-world productivity, supported by Horizon Ventures’ Soliton Drive (2040). **Cryonix** emerges in 2090, pioneering room-temperature superconductors using graphene-lattice composites, enhancing Soliton Drive efficiency by reducing magnetic coil energy loss by 25%. [[Finch Cybernetics]] introduces elegant, failure-prone implants by 2090, prized by elites but hacked on the gray market by [[AstroDyne]]’s rugged miner implants.
#### Cultural Impact

NS’s "Controlled Augs" (loyalists) clash with [[AstroDyne]]’s "Free Augs" (independents). [[Finch Cybernetics]]’ designs fuel a luxury subculture, while Naturalists—backed by the nascent [[Aya Collective]]—riot, decrying cybernetics as dehumanizing.
### Technological Context

Horizon Ventures and TerraCore Industries pioneer asteroid mining and lunar colonies by 2055, with [[Aeronautics Unlimited]] scaling their operations. [[Ewan Hart]]. supplies durable farming tech for early colonies, binding workers with debt.
### Corporate Consolidation

Horizon Ventures and TerraCore Industries merge into [[SolEx]] (2095), absorbing smaller rivals. [[AstroDyne]] and [[Orbital Forge]] persist as outliers, while [[NiteLife Energy]] emerges, powering colonies with “hip, young” energy solutions.
### Cultural Upheaval

The "Space Exodus" glorifies off-world life, marketed by [[Lucent Media]]’s reality shows, but Earth’s masses—echoed by [[Aya Collective]] protests—see it as servitude. The Earthbound Collective, with covert [[Framgång]] backing, attacks corporate hubs.
