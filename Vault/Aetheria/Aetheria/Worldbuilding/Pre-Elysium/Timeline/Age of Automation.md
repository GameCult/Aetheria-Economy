## 2100–2250
### [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI)

Key Players: [[CogniSys]], with [[Rossum & Douglas]] as a reliable fallback, and [[Orbital Forge]]’s rogue AI labs.

[[CogniSys]] deploys AGIs by 2105 for colony management and dissent control, using [[Rossum & Douglas]] hardware for stability and Cryonix superconductors for faster processing. [[Orbital Forge]] hacks [[CogniSys]] tech by 2120, creating anarchic AGIs—some form digital enclaves by 2200, occasionally hired by [[Lightsail Express]] for logistics despite their unreliability.

[[Cryonix]], founded in 2140, emerges as a leader in advanced superconductors, supplying zero-resistance materials to [[CogniSys]] for AGI cooling systems, boosting computational efficiency by 25%. [[Orbital Forge]] pirates [[Cryonix]] tech by 2150, creating jailbroken superconductor variants for black market applications.
#### Cultural Impact

Technocrats praise [[CogniSys]]’s order, "Free Minds" back [[Orbital Forge]]’s chaos, and the [[Aya Collective]] fears humanity’s eclipse, sparking unrest. [[Lucent Media]] broadcasts the divide as entertainment.
### [[Genetic Enhancement]]

Key Players: [[GeneSys]], with [[VitaForge]]’s mass-market tweaks and [[Zhestokost]]’s militarized enhancements.

[[GeneSys]] perfects elite enhancements by 2150—longevity, genius IQs—for the rich. [[VitaForge]] exploits leaked technology to create [[Biodrone]]s. [[Zhestokost]] enhances soldiers, aligning with [[GeneSys]]’s Ascended Caste.
#### Cultural Impact

[[GeneSys]]’s [[Ascended Caste]] dominates, [[VitaForge]]’s "Gene Commons" empower the [[Baseline League]]—backed by [[Aya Collective]]. [[Cetacean Navigators]] adopt eugenics, while [[Elephant Enclave]] and [[Aya Collective]] reject it. [[Lucent Media]] broadcasts the divide as a reality show.
### [[Biodrone]] Engineering

Key Players: [[VitaForge]], with [[SolEx]] adaptations and [[Corriedales]]’ entertainment spin.

[[VitaForge]] introduced [[Biodrone]]s in 2180—genetically engineered laborers with suppressed cognition. [[SolEx]] tweaks them by 2230 for harsh conditions, while [[Corriedales]] adapts them for gladiatorial spectacles, branding them “joyful sacrifices.”
#### Cultural Impact

[[VitaForge]]’s "[[Bio-Purists]]" feud with [[SolEx]]’s "[[Pragmatists]]." The [[Sentience Rebellion]], covertly aided by [[Aya Collective]] hackers, births the "[[Awakened Labor Front]]." [[Lucent Media]] sensationalizes the conflict.
### Corporate Consolidation

The [[Pan-Solar Consortium]] formed in 2230 to mediate, with [[NiteLife Energy]], [[Ewan Hart Inc]]., and [[Cryonix]] as key stakeholders. [[AstroDyne]] and [[Orbital Forge]] evade control, thriving on black-market tech.

The [[Pan-Solar Consortium]] establishes its headquarters on Mars, a neutral hub amidst growing lunar and asteroid colonies. Small outposts emerge in major trade hubs like Luna City and asteroid belt stations, staffed by bureaucrats and detachments of [[Private Military Contractors]]. It begins enforcing conflict permits, with a minimal presence focused on arbitration and surveillance via satellite networks.
### Cultural Upheaval

The "Automation Divide" grows, with [[Framgång]] selling overpriced gear to tech-elites and displaced workers alike, muddying the debate with vague “well-being” rhetoric.
