### From Sol to Elysium

When humanity finally escaped the prison of Earthâ€™s gravity and set off to colonize the final frontier, they rapidly expanded to claim every barren corner of Sol and fill it with life.

Soon they were trapped once again, this time by the insurmountable vastness of spacetime and its topological constraints. A thousand years passed, as factions competed brutally over control of the limited and steadily dwindling supply of natural resources. In this environment, a tenuous coalition formed around a technology which promised to unlock an even more final frontier: the FTL drive, a device capable of finally freeing humanity from the universal speed limit.

The FTL drive, by tapping into forces exotic and nonlocal, triggered a contingency put in place by a civilization with millions of years of experience and zero patience for competitors. Rather than journeying to a far-off system, all of humanity was abruptly shunted into an isolated shard of spacetime, along with every civilization to ever attempt FTL.

They called their destination Elysium in the hopes that the name would confer the sheen of paradise to the end of that impossible journey. They realized too late the true irony of the name: that, like the Elysium of myth, getting there was easy. Getting back...well. It turns out there's no return trip from the final frontier.
