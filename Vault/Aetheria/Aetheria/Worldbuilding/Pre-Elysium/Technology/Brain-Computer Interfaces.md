The cybernetics industry is highly competitive, with companies offering subscription-based enhancements, performance-boosting firmware, and even personalized neuro-marketing feeds.

Workers can shop between corporate BCI providers, each offering different levels of freedom vs. corporate control. Some corporations subsidize certain BCI models as part of employment packages, while independent contractors or freelancers must choose and pay for their own implants. Hackers and dissidents who operate outside official corporate oversight use certain "Gray-market" BCIs.

Competing neural firmware products create ecosystem lock-in, where users of one system struggle to migrate to another without losing functionality. The pan-solar government arbitrates disputes between competing BCI manufacturers, ensuring interoperability standards for the sake of market continuity.

Some corporations require their workers to have cybernetic implants that interface directly with company networks to maximize efficiency. Company loyalty is reinforced via subtle neurochemical conditioning, rewarding workers with dopamine for compliance and punishing disobedience with stress-inducing feedback loops.
