The rise of the Pan Solar Consortium Credit reflects the [[Pan-Solar Consortium]]’s economic leverage. By [[Eugenics Abyss]], corporate scrip replaced traditional currencies in off-world colonies, and the PSC standardized it into the PSCC, backed by collective corporate assets (e.g., [[SolEx]]’s minerals, [[NiteLife Energy]]’s energy). Its universal adoption is less a triumph of policy and more a necessity—colonies are too intertwined to function without a unified currency. The PSC enforces its stability through its [[Enforcement]], punishing noncompliance with isolation. This cements the PSCC’s dominance, even as the PSC itself remains a hollow shell.
